# This is a Markdown file

## Subheading

### Sub-sub-heading

#### Sub-sub-sub-heading

This is a normal paragraph. In a markdown file, you are working with straight up plain text. There are no frills, but you get to control it.

1. It's a text editor that fits your needs, and is almost a programming language itself.
2. You can **bold** things, or *italicize them*
1. You can mess up on your numbering
1. you can include code snippets ```like this ```
  1. and you can also indent
  2. and keep sub-numbering


```python
count = 0

for word in range(len(list)):
	if list[word] == "True":
		count = count + 1

print(count)
```

I can include a [hyperlink](https://lingusitics.ucsc.edu).

This is how you make a line break :

---

I can have tables:

|   | a | b | c |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |   |   |   |   |
| 2 |   |   |   |   |
| 3 |   |   |   |   |

And so much more. All you have to do is have a file extension of **.md**
