gyre = """Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity."""

#==============================
# Main Goal:
#   Make a Pig Latin Generator
#   Generate the PigLatin version of 'gyre'
#==============================

# First: Let's ignore the poem. How do we make these into pig latin:
#   - gyre
#   - and



# Second: how would we modify this for a word like
#       'things'




#------------------------------
# Sub goals:
#   - make all the data lowercase
#   - get rid of punctuation
#   - save the text into a list that we can manipulate
#   - save information about what words are on what lines
#   - write our pig latin generator
#   - print our pig latin-ified poem
#------------------------------

# get rid of punctiation & make lowercase



# save the text to a list



# write our pig latin generator
