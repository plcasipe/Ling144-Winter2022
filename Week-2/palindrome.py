# Palindromes are strings that that read the same backwards as well as forwards:
#   --Round 1--
#   kayak
#   peep
#   --Round 2--
#   a toyota
#   A man, a plan, a canal, Panama
#   Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog


# take in user input
example = input('Give me a palindrome: ')
print(example)

# Take user input and use a loop to:
#   Save the first letter as the last letter, second letter as second to last letter, etc...
 


# clean up user input: lowercase, remove space and punctuation




# test and print out 
# if input is less than or equal to 2 (too short)
#   print it's too short
# if it's a palindrome, 
#  print a confirmation
# if it's not a palindrome
#   print that it's not a palindrome
